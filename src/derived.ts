/**
 * Creates a memoized derived state mapper function that caches results based on input identity.
 *
 * The memoization uses `Object.is` to compare inputs, making it ideal for use with
 * immutable state objects. When the input reference hasn't changed, the cached output
 * is returned without re-executing the function.
 *
 * This is the required way to create mapper functions for use with `useDerivedState`.
 *
 * @template I - The input type
 * @template O - The output type
 * @param fn - A pure function that transforms input to output
 * @returns A memoized derived mapper function
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const selectStats = derived(({ items }: AppState) => ({
 *   total: items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0),
 *   count: items.length
 * }));
 *
 * // Use with useDerivedState
 * const stats = useDerivedState(model, selectStats);
 * ```
